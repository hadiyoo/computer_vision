## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hadiyoo/computer_vision.git
   cd computer_vision
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- (Optional) PyTorch or TensorFlow if deep learning is included  

## Features
- Image loading and preprocessing  
- Filtering and transformations  
- Feature extraction  
- Model training and evaluation (if applicable)  
- Saving outputs for visualization  

## Future Improvements
- Add more advanced CV models (YOLO, CNNs, segmentation, etc.)  
- Add interactive visualizations  
- Improve documentation for each script  
- Add more datasets and examples
